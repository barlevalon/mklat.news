## Real-time Architecture

- **Backend**: Polls OREF/Ynet APIs every 2 seconds, broadcasts changes via WebSocket
- **Frontend**: Receives instant WebSocket updates with automatic fallback to 3-second polling
- **Connection Status**: Visual indicator shows real-time/polling/offline status
- **Resilience**: Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff

## Data Sources

- **Ynet RSS**: `https://www.ynet.co.il/Integration/StoryRss1854.xml`
- **Current Alerts**: `https://www.oref.org.il/warningMessages/alert/Alerts.json`

- **Alert Areas**: `https://alerts-history.oref.org.il/Shared/Ajax/GetDistricts.aspx?lang=he`
- **Fallback Alerts**: `https://api.tzevaadom.co.il/notifications`

All data comes directly from official Israeli government sources with real-time updates.
